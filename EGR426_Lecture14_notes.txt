Mealy State Machines
* Output depends on current state and how you reached that state.
* Input change causes an immediate output change.

	Huffman Coding Style
	* Characterizes it as a combination block with feedbacks through an array of
		registers.
	
	More Modular Style
	* Has block for handling transitions, and one for assigning values to 
		outputs

	ROM Based Controller
	* Present the present state and the inputs
	* Address: input & current state
	  Data at address: output & next state
		ex: state: 00, input: 1, output: 0, next state: 01
			Address: 100, data at address: 001

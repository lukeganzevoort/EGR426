Synthesis - converts VHDL into boolean operations
* Combination Synthesis
	* Gate Level Synthesis
		* Using predefined primitives
		* AND, OR, NOR, etc... gates
	* Synthesizing Continuous Assignments
		* Multiple assignments are also allowed in synthesis
	* Behavioral Synthesis
		* Input Sensitivity
		* Output Assignments
			* Default
			* Else conditions
	* Mixed Synthesis
		* slide 23	bullet 1											(quiz)
* Sequential Synthesis
	* Latch Modelling
	* Flip-Flop Modelling
	* Memory Initialization
		* COE - coefficient
	A General Sequential Circuit Synthesis

Vivado Logic Analyzer
* Debug and verification (40% of time)
* Debugging
	* Break the problem into smaller parts and test
	* Probes, Implement, Analyze, Fix
	* ILA (integrated logic analyzer) and VIO (virtual input output)
